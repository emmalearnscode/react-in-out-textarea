## Taking your issue

Most common use case is to actually just take one ticket. I put a lot of effort into making the tickets as easy as possible to understand. Normally, every ticket can be worked on, even if you do not have a lot of knowledge about technologies that are used in this repository.

Once you are ready to take your issue, please write in the issue that you want to take the issue or assign it to yourself. With that you will make sure no one else will do the same work as you. If you are not sure if you can take the issue, please ask in the issue.

## Technologies we use

We use the following core technologies:

- React.js - [Docs](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html)
- Storybook - [Docs](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/get-started/introduction)
- TypeScript - [Docs](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/intro.html)
- styled-components - [Docs](https://www.styled-components.com/docs/basics)

If you struggle with the usage of one of them, feel free to follow the documentation linked above or simply ask on your ticket. I will try to help you to understand or onboard quickly to the technologies.
